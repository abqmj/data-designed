		<title>Use case for a very bad ETSY site</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>First a quick explanation of Autographsy</h1>
		<p>Autographsy is a site for signed Memorabilia with an ETSY twist. In the future users would be able to view and purchase signed/autographed memorabilia from their favorite Sports stars, but also Celebrities.</p>
		<p>Also in the future autographsy will offer user to client services allowing users to reach out to the professional fans(guys who get autographs for a living) for a specific autograph. For example if your a dog lover and owned a boxer you might want a dog collar signed by the greatest boxer ever Floyd Money Mayweather.</p>
		<h1>Now onto the use-case for Autographsy(phase 0)</h1>
		<p> For the time being users are limited to liking their favorite autographed memorabilia. So users can create an account and login into the site to browse the different memorabilia.</p>
