		<h1>This is my very first persona!</h1>
<p>This is the persona Gerrit. A HUGE Aaron Rodgers fan despite what the restraining order says he is no stalker. Gerrit's Mom's home state being Wisconsin loving the Green Bay Packers is in his blood. Despite being from Arizona he loves wearing Packer gear every chance he gets. He also collects game worn jerseys the dirtier the more collectible, at least that is what he tells people.
